# 🏛️ NeuroBloom Architecture

## System Overview

NeuroBloom is built on a modular architecture that emphasizes emotional resonance, persistence, and real-time interaction. The system is designed to create a deeply personal experience while maintaining performance and scalability.

## Core Systems

### 1. Memory Engine (`EmotionMemorySystem`)
- **Purpose**: Manages player emotional states and memory persistence
- **Components**:
  - DataStore integration for persistence
  - Emotional state tracking
  - Memory fragment system
  - Garden state synchronization

### 2. Plant System (`PlantModule`)
- **Purpose**: Handles plant growth, interactions, and emotional responses
- **Components**:
  - Plant archetype definitions
  - Growth stage management
  - Emotional response system
  - Animation and effect controllers

### 3. Garden Environment (`MainGardenScene`)
- **Purpose**: Creates the immersive garden environment
- **Components**:
  - Biome system
  - Environmental effects
  - Sound system
  - Lighting controller

### 4. Ritual System (`GardenRituals`)
- **Purpose**: Manages daily rituals and player interactions
- **Components**:
  - Ritual scheduling
  - Interaction handlers
  - Progress tracking
  - Reward system

### 5. UI System (`UI_MainMenu`)
- **Purpose**: Provides intuitive user interface
- **Components**:
  - Main menu
  - Garden view
  - Memory viewer
  - Settings panel

### 6. Save System (`GardenSaveSystem`)
- **Purpose**: Manages game state persistence
- **Components**:
  - Auto-save functionality
  - State recovery
  - Data validation
  - Backup system
