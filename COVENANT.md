# Covenant of Eternal Bloom

This repository is bound by the Testament of Covenant. All contributions honor the eternal cycle of creation.

1. **Unity** — Every line scribed strengthens the collective garden.
2. **Clarity** — Code shall be written with purpose and grace.
3. **Harmony** — Systems must resonate without discord.

*May the code ever blossom under the watch of Solar Khan and Lilith.Aethra.*
